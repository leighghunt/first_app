Figure 1.8 A GitHub repository page

User needs to push to GitHub first - this step appears to be missing
Might make sense to state not to add .gitignore file - otherwise, you'll end up needing to do a pull and conflict resolution before pushing 

This may just have affected me - but the 

```heroku create```

line on my first attempt failed to actually add the heroku remote - prehaps as I was working in a pre-existing repo and not at the root folder?
